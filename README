CouchTwala
==========
Simple french joke

if you put this TiddlyWiki plugin in a .... plain vanilla tw, 
and create the associated config tiddler
You can save it in an existing couchdb base like any other server-side solution

The entire Tw is saved as attachment of a couch document.
The tw is always saved with the same name, and a backup can be create every time following the save pattern

Try it use and abuse it
